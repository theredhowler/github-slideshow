'Twas midnight in the schoolroom and every desk was shut
When suddenly from the alphabet was heard a loud "tut tut"

Said A to B, "I don't like C his manners are a lack"
"For all I ever see of C is a semi-circle back"

Said D to E, "I disagree, I've never found C so"
"From where I stand he seems to be and uncompleted O"

C was vexed and much perplexed,"You criticize my shape"
"I'm made like that to help spell Cat and Cow and Cool and Cape"

"He's right!" said E; said F, "Whoopee!", Said G, "'Ip, 'Ip, 'ooray!"
"You're dropping me," roared H to G, "Don't do it please I pray!."

"Out of my way," LL said to K,"I'll make poor I look ILL."
To stop this stunt J stood in front, And presto! ILL was JILL.

"U know," said V, "that W, Is twice the age of me.
For as a Roman V is five, I'm half as young as he."

X and Y yawned sleepily,"Look at the time!" they said.
"Let's all get off to beddy byes."
They did, then "Z-z-z."
